# Delivrio
Delivrio is a courier management system that allows customers to specify the items they want to courier, and based on their shape, size, value, and other factors, our system determines a fair price for the courier services. Additionally, our interface enables customers to track the current location, estimated time of arrival (ETA), and status of the delivery person, as well as they can access many other features available on Delivrio.
